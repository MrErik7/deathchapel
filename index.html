                        <h3>Erik Gustafsson</h3>
                        <p>Born in a goat family, he was first introduced to society at the age of 6 when he was put to
                            a trial of blood. Having suffered many amputations, setbacks and deaths, whilst jerking off
                            Erik got a vision for a great band which he and the drummer Sode started up, they teamed up
                            with a guitarist by the name of Isaac. Shortly thereafter the infamous Gabriel Sepulveda
                            joined the band.

                        <p>Gabriel was born on a cold, dark winter night on July the 5th. After escaping the great
                            plague, the upcoming winter almost took his life. When hearing the electric banana band for
                            the first time combined with 10 tabs of acid, he started playing guitar. After that he was
                            hooked, after meeting the lead singer in the local satanic church he was introduced to the
                            band Death Chapel.

                        <h3>Sode Timmerås</h3>
                        <p>Sode is a metal drummer known for his fierce beats and technical prowess. He is called "Ice Beard" by his fans and fellow musicians due to his long, white beard and cool demeanor on stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite his successful career, Sode's life was filled with tragedy. As a child, he was orphaned and forced to fend for himself on the streets. He found solace in music and honed his skills as a drummer.</p>
                        <p>In an orgy with the lead singer, Erik, he overheard Eriks vision and teamed up with him to form what is now called Death Chapel.</p>
